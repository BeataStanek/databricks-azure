# Overview
This is a demo repo to showcase how to build Databricks on Azure using Terraform Cloud.

It will create a Databricks workspace in Azure along with a notebook, a job, and a cluster. There is a Sentinel policy to restrict total number of maximum workers for a cluster and the worker VM size.
